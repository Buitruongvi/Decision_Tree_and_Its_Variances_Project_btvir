# Tabular Data Project: Heart Disease Prediction

In this project, we will apply basic machine learning methods to predict whether an individual is prone to heart disease or not, 
based on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Cleveland dataset comprises 14 features, 
including age, gender, chest-pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, 
maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, peak exercise ST segment, the number of 
major vessels illuminated by fluoroscopy (ranging from 0 to 3), thalassemia presence, and heart disease diagnosis (0 representing no heart disease 
and 1, 2, 3, 4 representing varying degrees of heart disease). The Cleveland dataset consists of 303 samples, and these 14 features.

We will utilize various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is susceptible to heart disease or not. These algorithms include naive Bayes, 
k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, gradient boost, XGBoost, and support vector machine (SVM). We will integrate them using bagging, boosting, and stacking techniques.

## 1. KNN
Use the KNN algorithm to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease or not, using the following parameters: `n_neighbors=5`, `weights='uniform'`, `algorithm='auto'`, `leaf_size=30`, `p=2`, `metric='minkowski'`.
